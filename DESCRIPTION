Version: 0.1.0

Description: This package downloads a satellite image via Google Earth (these are
    often originally from Landsat), 
    translates the image into a perceptually uniform color space,
    runs one of a few different clustering algorithms on the colors in the image 
    searching for a user supplied number of colors,
    and returns the resulting color palette.
